# PharmXplorer: Drug–Gene Interaction Dashboard

PharmXplorer is a Streamlit web application for querying and visualizing drug–gene interactions using the DGIdb (Drug–Gene Interaction Database) GraphQL API.

The app allows users to input a human gene (e.g., `TP53`, `BRCA1`) or drug (e.g., `Trastuzumab`, `Tamoxifen`) and retrieve known interaction partners, along with corresponding interaction scores and types. It offers a lightweight, interactive interface suitable for research, education, and exploratory analysis in pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine.

- Interactive results: View and filter tabular data with interaction scores  
- Download support: Export results as a `.csv` file  
- Visualizations
- Live API access: Uses DGIdb’s GraphQL API for real-time data

## Example Use Cases

- A researcher exploring therapeutic targets of a cancer-associated gene  
- A bioinformatician validating gene–drug associations in a pharmacogenomics dataset  
- A clinician or student investigating known drug–gene interactions for educational purposes
