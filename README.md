# PharmXplorer: Drug–Gene Interaction Dashboard

PharmXplorer is a Streamlit web application for querying and visualizing drug–gene interactions using the DGIdb GraphQL API, now extended with pharmacogenomic variant annotations from PharmGKB.

Users can input a human gene (e.g., `TP53`, `EGFR`) or drug (e.g., `Clopidogrel`, `Tamoxifen`) and retrieve known interaction partners, along with interaction scores, types, and pharmacogenomic insights. It provides an interactive, lightweight interface suitable for bioinformatics, precision medicine, research, and education in pharmacogenomics.

## App Structure

The application includes four main pages:

1. **Home**  
   Search by entering a drug or gene name and choosing a search mode.

2. **Interaction Table**  
   View and explore interaction results from DGIdb, pharmacogenomic variant-drug associations from PharmGKB.

3. **Interaction Visuals - Pharamcogenomic Variants**  
   View bar charts and distribution plots summarizing drug–gene interactions, including interaction types and partners.

   **Variant Annotations** (NEW)  
   Visualize curated clinical annotations from PharmGKB related to drug–gene–variant relationships:
   - Top 10 genes with the most variant annotations  
   - Phenotype category distributions (e.g., efficacy, toxicity)  
   - Score distributions across phenotype categories  
   - Heatmaps of gene vs. Clinical Annotation relationships
