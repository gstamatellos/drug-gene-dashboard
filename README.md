# PharmXplorer: Drug–Gene Interaction Dashboard

PharmXplorer is a Streamlit web application for querying and visualizing drug–gene interactions using the DGIdb (Drug–Gene Interaction Database) GraphQL API.

The app allows users to input a human gene (e.g., `TP53`, `BRCA1`) or drug (e.g., `Trastuzumab`, `Tamoxifen`) and retrieve known interaction partners, along with corresponding interaction scores and types. It offers a lightweight, interactive interface suitable for research, education, and exploratory analysis in pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine.
