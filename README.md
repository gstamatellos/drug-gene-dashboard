# PharmXplorer: Drug–Gene Interaction Dashboard

PharmXplorer is a Streamlit web application for querying and visualizing drug–gene interactions using the DGIdb (Drug–Gene Interaction Database) GraphQL API, now extended with **pharmacogenomic variant annotations** from **PharmGKB**.

The app allows users to input a human gene (e.g., `TP53`, `BRCA1`) or drug (e.g., `Trastuzumab`, `Tamoxifen`) and retrieve known interaction partners, along with corresponding interaction scores, types, and pharmacogenomic insights. It offers a lightweight, interactive interface suitable for research, education, and exploratory analysis in pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics, and precision medicine.

## App Structure

The application has four main pages:

1. **Home**  
   Input a gene or drug name and trigger the search using the DGIdb API.

2. **Interaction Table**  
   View retrieved interaction data, summary statistics, and download the results as a CSV file.

3. **Interaction Visuals**  
   Display plots of top-scoring interactions and explore interaction types.

4. **Variant Annotations** *(NEW)*  
   Visualize curated clinical annotations from PharmGKB related to gene–drug interactions, including variant-specific efficacy and toxicity information.
