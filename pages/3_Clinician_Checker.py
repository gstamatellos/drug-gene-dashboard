### **Coming soon:** Clinician Safety Checker  
This tool helps clinicians assess **pharmacogenomic risks before prescribing a drug**, using clinical annotations from **PharmGKB**.

✅ Identify **gene-drug interactions** that affect **safety, dosing, or efficacy**  
⚠️ Highlights high-risk associations (e.g., **Level 1A/1B**, **toxicity**, **non-response**)  
📋 Filter results by **phenotype category** or **evidence level**

For each searched drug, the tool will **automatically suggest a gene panel** — a list of genes worth testing — to support personalized treatment decisions.
